## Overview

Congratulations on landing a FANTM DEVLPR! Getting started is simple: plug it right into your Arduino and double-check the "Key Points" to confirm everything is ready to go.

Once the hardware is ready, go to [the supporting Arduino library](../../software/libdevlpr) to start programming away.
